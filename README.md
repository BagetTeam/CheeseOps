# 🧀 ECSE223 CheECSEManager Project: Team 2

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Make a branch with a your name and what you are working on (e.g. git branch "mingli/the-feature-you-are-working-on").
3. Make changes, commit, and push.
4. When you are done, make a Pull Request into main. You can request reviewers to review your code if you want to confirm your changes.
5. If there is any conflicts, ask the person who worked on the file before you to make sure you are not overridding important stuff, then resolve it.
6. Merge the PR

## Important Notes

Make sure to have Java 21. The TA uses an old verison of Gradle (8.6) which only Java <=21 supports. If you have a version higher than 21, your LSP will not work and you won't get autocomplete in VSCode/Neovim/Zed/etc.. I haven't tried on Eclipse since I wasn't able to install it, but the Neovim plugin jdtls-nvim that I use is based on the jdtls from Eclipse so chances are it won't work.

## Running tests

Install gradle and run `gradle test -t`
